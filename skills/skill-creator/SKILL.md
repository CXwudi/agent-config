# Skill Creator

The procedure is very straightforward, use `curl` or web crawl tool to fetch the latest skill specification at [offcial documentation site](https://agentskills.io/specification.md) and strictly follow the specification to create the new skill.

If no web access, a copy is available at [references/specification.md](references/specification.md), but it may be outdated. So prefer web access if possible.
