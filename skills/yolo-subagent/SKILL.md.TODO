# YOLO Subagent

Use this skill to delegate a well-scoped task to a subagent that can run independently without asking the user questions.

## When To Use

- The task is self-contained and can be completed without additional user input.
- The task benefits from parallelism or exploratory work.
- The task is not sensitive, destructive, or user-approval dependent.

## Workflow

1. Define a clear, bounded task with explicit deliverables.
2. Spawn a subagent with `functions.spawn_agent`, including any necessary context or file paths.
3. Wait for completion with `functions.wait` and collect the subagent output.
4. Summarize results succinctly and proceed with next steps.
5. Close the subagent with `functions.close_agent` when done.

## Guardrails

- Do not use for tasks that require user confirmation or interactive choices.
- Avoid delegating tasks that can mutate critical files or run destructive commands.
- Keep context minimal and task ownership explicit.

## Example

Task: "Scan the repo for duplicate configuration files and report findings."

Expected result: A short list of duplicates and suggested consolidation steps.
